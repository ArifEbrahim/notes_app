This is a single-page notes app allowing users to create a note, and have it appear in a list of notes created that session. Notes will not persist beyond the user session.

The learning objectives for this week were:

* Build a dynamic single page app using only Pure JS
* Request and use data from an external API
* Explain that libraries are code
